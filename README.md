# pagefault-sim

Spencer Wolf

## What is this?

This is a simulator of a demand paging system used in modern opertating
systems. When complete it will test various page replacement algorithms in
order to serve as a teaching tool for CS students.

## Why is this?

I originally coded this project for my operating systems course using the C
programming language (technically is was compiled in C++ but I like C more so I
didn't make any calls to the C++ libraries). I had a lot of fun because we were 
allowed to complete this project in any fashion we wanted. 

Anywho coded some Go a year ago and I really liked it do I decided I wanted to 
upskill and figured re-coding this project in Go would be a good place to start.
